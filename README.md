# A quote generator

## About The Project

By using quotes API, you can create a quote generator. If the quote is longer than 120 characters then the size becomes smaller. If the author is unknown then we use textContent to replace the "null" value to "unknown". You can also tweet about it by pressing the tweet button, which will link to your account in a new window.
I have added the CSS loader, so if theres a delay in fetching a quote, the quote container will be hidden and the css loader will appear.
You can use this for your blogs, or simply learn the methods applied.

## Built With

You should be familiar with JavaScript basics. But I have linked some resources.

1. [Node.textContent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent)
2. [try/catch method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent)
3. [hidden element](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_hidden.asp)

## Installation

This is a working code example.
You can copy the CSS and Javascript code as is and use it in your projects.
Or you can download the code as a ZIP file and unzip it. No web server required, you can see it live through your localhost by opening index.html with your browser. Alternatively, you can open your project with VS Code (download live server extension) and click on **Go Live** at the bottom right corner, it should open in your default browser.
